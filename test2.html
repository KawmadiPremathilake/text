 <blockquote>
 Over 1250 years have passed since the foundation of <b>Kiyomizu-dera Temple</b>. Halfway up Mt. Otowa,one of the peaks in Kyoto’s <i>Higashiyama mountain range</i>, stands the temple, to which large numbers of visitors come to pay their respects to Kannon, a deity of great mercy and compassion. For this reason, our temple is known as a <u>“Kannon Reijo.</u>” <u>“Reijo”</u> is a Japanese word meaning a “holy place”with which the Kannon’s compassion is abundant.
